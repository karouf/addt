## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.10] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Podman support**: Podman as default container provider with auto-download and machine setup on macOS
- **OpenTelemetry** (experimental): Tracing support with configurable endpoint, protocol, and per-extension OTEL vars
- **Orchestrator** (experimental): Web interface for session management (`addt-orchestrator`)
- **`addt update <extension> [version]`**: Force-rebuild extension to latest or specific version
- **`addt init`**: Interactive project configuration setup
- **GPG forwarding**: Proxy-based GPG agent forwarding with key ID filtering
- **SSH proxy mode**: Default SSH forwarding via proxy agent with key filtering
- **Tmux forwarding**: Socket forwarding for tmux sessions (disabled by default)
- **Shell history persistence**: Per-project shell history between container sessions
- **Credential scripts**: Extension-level credential management via `cred.sh`
- **Secret isolation**: Secrets delivered via tmpfs/docker-cp instead of environment variables
- **Security hardening**: cap_drop/cap_add, seccomp profiles, user namespaces, read-only rootfs, tmpfs sizing, PID/nofile limits, network_mode, disable_devices, disable_ipc, time_limit
- **Progress indicators**: Visual feedback during build and container operations
- **Native Claude support**: Run Claude Code natively on macOS without container
- **Extension flags**: Config-driven flags (e.g., `yolo`) that map to environment variables
- **Default column**: Config list views now show Key, Value, Default, and Source columns

### Changed
- **Config namespacing**: Flat config keys reorganized into nested namespaces:
  - `firewall`/`firewall_mode` → `firewall.enabled`/`firewall.mode`
  - `ssh_forward_keys`/`ssh_forward_mode`/`ssh_allowed_keys` → `ssh.*`
  - `docker_cpus`/`docker_memory` → `container.cpus`/`container.memory`
  - `gpg_forward`/`gpg_allowed_key_ids` → `gpg.*`
  - `workdir`/`workdir_automount`/`workdir_readonly` → `workdir.*`
  - `log_enabled`/`log_file` → `log.*` with output, dir, level, modules, rotation
  - New `vm.cpus`/`vm.memory` for Podman machine / Docker Desktop VM resources
- **Config list**: Shared table formatting across global, project, and extension views
- **Improved help text**: Extension config commands documented with examples
- **Rebuild logic**: Avoid unnecessary rebuilds when only embedded assets change
- **Firewall rules**: Stored in config files with layered evaluation
- **GitHub token**: Default to `gh_auth` token source
- **Logging**: Full-featured logger with module filtering, log rotation, and configurable output

### Fixed
- Completion for all shell types (bash, zsh, fish)
- System prompt null byte handling
- Time limit enforcement
- Persistent container mode reliability
- Extension rebuilding on every run
- Concurrent addt safety with PID-based cleanup
- CI: Skip slow integration tests in short mode

## [0.0.9] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- Don't modify mounted Claude config when automount is enabled
- Existing authentication (OAuth, API key) is now completely preserved
- Removes unintended modification of user's host config via jq

## [0.0.8] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- Preserve OAuth credentials when `automount` is enabled for Claude extension
- setup.sh now detects existing Claude config and preserves authentication
- Only adds `/workspace` trust to existing config instead of overwriting

### Added
- Docker-based integration tests for Claude extension setup.sh behavior

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Auto-configure Claude Code for headless operation when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
- Auto-trust API key (using last 20 characters)
- Pre-trust `/workspace` directory to skip trust prompts
- Include addt version in Docker image names for automatic rebuilds
- Firewall network behavior integration tests

### Changed
- Claude extension `auto_mount` now defaults to `false` (opt-in for session persistence)
- Moved firewall config tests from integration to unit tests
- Updated README: document `automount` setting for subscription users
- Added version conflict warning for auto-mount mode

## [0.0.6] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Firewall command with global/project/extension scopes
- Layered firewall rule evaluation (defaults → extension → global → project)
- Project-level rules can override global rules
- Per-extension firewall configuration
- `addt firewall global|project|extension` subcommands
- `CheckDomain()` function for programmatic firewall checks
- `addt run <extension>` command for running agents
- Codebase refactoring: split large files into focused modules

### Changed
- Firewall rules now stored in config files (`~/.addt/config.yaml`, `.addt.yaml`)
- Moved firewall code to dedicated `cmd/firewall/` package
- Restructured README for progressive disclosure (quick start first)
- Improved documentation with clearer configuration examples

## [0.0.5] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Support for `addt-<extension>` symlink naming (e.g., `addt-claude`, `addt-codex`)

## [0.0.4] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Two-stage Docker build for faster extension builds
- Base image (`addt-base:nodeXX-uidXXX`) caches Node, Go, UV, and system packages
- Extension images build FROM base, taking only ~10-30 seconds
- `--addt-rebuild-base` flag to force base image rebuild

### Changed
- `--addt-rebuild` now only rebuilds extension layer (uses cached base)
- Dockerfile split into `Dockerfile.base` and `Dockerfile`

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- Look up actual entrypoint from extension config instead of using extension name
- Fixes extensions where name differs from entrypoint: kiro→kiro-cli, beads→bd, gastown→gt, etc.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- Auto-detect command from `ADDT_EXTENSIONS` when `ADDT_COMMAND` is not set
- Running `ADDT_EXTENSIONS=codex addt` now correctly runs codex instead of defaulting to claude

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- Initial alpha release of addt (AI Don't Do That)
- Complete rewrite in Go with provider-based architecture
- Multi-agent support via extension system
- 14 extensions available:
  - **AI Agents**: claude, codex, gemini, copilot, amp, cursor, kiro
  - **Claude Ecosystem**: claude-flow, claude-sneakpeek, openclaw, tessl, gastown
  - **Utilities**: beads, backlog-md
- Docker provider with image building and container management
- Daytona provider (experimental) for cloud-based workspaces
- Symlink-based agent selection (binary name determines which agent runs)
- Automatic environment variable forwarding based on extension config
- Extension dependency resolution
- Network firewall with whitelist-based domain filtering
- SSH agent forwarding and GPG key forwarding
- Docker-in-Docker support (isolated and host modes)
- Automatic port mapping with host port detection
- Persistent container mode for faster startup
- Command logging support

### Technical
- Go 1.21+ with embedded assets (Dockerfile, extensions)
- Cross-platform builds: darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64
- Provider interface for pluggable container runtimes
- Extension metadata in config.yaml with install.sh, setup.sh, args.sh scripts

### Notes
- This is an alpha release - expect breaking changes
- Previously known as "dclaude" and "nddt" (Nope, Don't Do That)
- Renamed to "addt" (AI Don't Do That) to reflect multi-agent support
